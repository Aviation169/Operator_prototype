# AI Agent Prototype 🤖

A smart agent that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand natural language tasks and perform real-world actions like sending emails, searching Google, or playing YouTube videos — all through browser automation.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

This prototype is an experiment in combining **language understanding** with **agentic automation**. It allows you to:

- 📧 **Send Gmail emails** with just a sentence prompt  
- 🔍 **Search Google** using @search commands  
- 📺 **Play YouTube videos** using @youtube queries  

All powered by an LLM and browser control via **Playwright**.

---

## ✨ Examples

Just type:

Send an email to "example@gmail.com" about "meeting update"

The agent interprets your intent and automates the full process in the browser.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Playwright (async)** for browser automation
- **Local LLM** (model-agnostic) for task understanding
- **Regex + heuristics** for fallback extraction
- **Command-line input** interface

---

## 📦 Features

- Natural language input → structured action
- Robust email composition via Gmail web interface
- Real-time search and YouTube video playback
- Consent handling and UI interaction automation
- Custom Chrome profile support

## 🧑‍💻 Developed By

**Ajay & Sridhar** — two developers passionate about the power of AI agents and automation.  
This project is a hands-on exploration of how LLMs can enable real utility through action-based agents.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

🚧 **This is a working prototype.**  
It is not optimized for production use. Expect occasional bugs, delays, or browser inconsistencies.

Use it only in controlled environments or for learning and experimentation purposes.

---

## 💡 Inspired By

The architecture is influenced by OpenAI’s vision of **Operator Agent AI** — systems that reason through user intent and take multi-step actions using tools.  
This prototype brings that concept to life in a basic, open, and local setting.
